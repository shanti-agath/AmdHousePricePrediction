## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains housing-related attributes including:

* Area / size of the house
* Number of bedrooms
* Number of bathrooms
* Location-related features
* Target variable: **House Price**

Missing values were handled before model training to ensure data quality.

## 🧠 Model Used

* **Linear Regression**

Linear Regression was chosen as it is a simple and interpretable algorithm suitable for predicting continuous numerical values like house prices.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The model performance was evaluated using:

* **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains variance in house prices
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Measures average prediction error

These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
