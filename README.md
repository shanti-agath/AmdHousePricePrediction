# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Ahmedabad based on various features such as location, size, and number of rooms. Accurate price prediction helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains housing-related attributes including:

* Area / size of the house
* Number of bedrooms
* Number of bathrooms
* Location-related features
* Target variable: **House Price**

Missing values were handled before model training to ensure data quality.

##  Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Feature selection and preprocessing
4. Train-test split
5. Model training using **Linear Regression**
6. Model evaluation using regression metrics

---

## Model Used

* **Linear Regression**

Linear Regression was chosen as it is a simple and interpretable algorithm suitable for predicting continuous numerical values like house prices.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The model performance was evaluated using:

* **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains variance in house prices
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Measures average prediction error

These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
